=========================
CRITICAL DIFFERENTIATION RULES
=========================

1. If headers contain BOTH:
   - "MAIN REINF." AND "DISTRIBUTION REINF."
   → RETURN 8

2. If headers are SIMPLE (few columns, no short/long separation)
   → DO NOT select 9

3. Pattern 9 is ONLY when:
   - BOTH MAIN + DISTRIBUTION exist
   INSIDE:
   - BOTTOM REINFORCEMENT
   - TOP SUPPORT REINFORCEMENT

   Example:
   BOTTOM REINFORCEMENT (MAIN + DISTRIBUTION)
   TOP SUPPORT REINFORCEMENT (MAIN + DISTRIBUTION)

   → ONLY THEN RETURN 9

4. Pattern 6 / 7 detection:

   If headers contain:
   - BOTTOM REINFORCEMENT ALONG SHORT SPAN
   - BOTTOM REINFORCEMENT ALONG LONG SPAN
   - TOP SUPPORT REINFORCEMENT ALONG SHORT SPAN
   - TOP SUPPORT REINFORCEMENT ALONG LONG SPAN

   AND DO NOT explicitly split into MAIN vs DISTRIBUTION

   → RETURN 6 or 7 (NOT 9)

5. Difference between 6 and 7:

   - Pattern 6 contains:
     "MAIN REINF." and "DISTRIBUTION REINF." labels in header description

   - Pattern 7 does NOT explicitly label them as MAIN/DISTRIBUTION
     but only uses SHORT/LONG span wording
